## These functions cache the inverse of a matrix. If the inverse 
## for the matrix has already been calculated, the inverse is 
## retrieved and returned. 
## If not, the inverse is computed and stored.


## This function creates a special "matrix" object that 
## can cache its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  
  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setmean <- function(mean) m <<- mean
  getmean <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setmean = setmean,
       getmean = getmean)
  
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" 
## returned by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already 
## been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the 
## cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
